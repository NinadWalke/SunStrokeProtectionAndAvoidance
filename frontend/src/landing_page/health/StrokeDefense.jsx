          <h3>How does one defend themselves from Sun Strokes?</h3>
          <img src="" alt="StrokeDefenseImage" />
          <p>
            Sunstroke, also known as heat stroke, is a serious condition that
            occurs when the body becomes overheated due to prolonged exposure to
            high temperatures, particularly in hot and humid environments. It
            can lead to life-threatening complications if not addressed
            promptly. To prevent sunstroke, it is essential to take proactive
            measures such as staying hydrated, wearing appropriate clothing, and
            limiting exposure to direct sunlight during peak hours. Using
            sunscreen, avoiding strenuous activities in extreme heat, and being
            mindful of early symptoms like dizziness or nausea can further
            reduce the risk. By adopting these practices, individuals can
            effectively protect themselves from the harmful effects of
            sunstroke.

          <h3>Methods to defend yourself</h3>
          <h4 className="mt-3">1. Stay Hydrated</h4>
          <p>
            Proper hydration is one of the most important defenses against
            sunstroke. When exposed to high temperatures, the body loses fluids
            through sweat, and failing to replenish them can lead to
            dehydration, which increases the risk of heat-related illnesses.
            It’s crucial to drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially
            during extended outdoor activities. Even if you don’t feel thirsty,
            drinking water regularly helps maintain your body’s cooling system.
            It’s equally important to avoid drinks that can dehydrate you, such
            as alcohol and caffeinated beverages, as they can exacerbate
            dehydration and make the body more susceptible to overheating.
          </p>
          <h4>2. Limit Sun Exposure</h4>
          <p>
            Choosing the right clothing can make a significant difference in
            protecting yourself from sunstroke. Lightweight, loose-fitting, and
            light-colored clothes are ideal for reflecting heat and allowing
            airflow, which helps the body regulate temperature more efficiently.
            Dark colors tend to absorb heat, making you feel hotter, while tight
            clothing can restrict air circulation, increasing discomfort. A
            wide-brimmed hat provides shade for your face, neck, and shoulders,
            reducing direct sun exposure to these vulnerable areas. Sunglasses
            protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, preventing eye strain and
            damage, making proper clothing an essential part of sunstroke
            prevention.
          </p>
          <h4>3. Use Sunscreen</h4>
          <p>
            Applying sunscreen is not just about preventing sunburn; it also
            plays a key role in protecting your body from overheating. Sunburn
            can impair the body’s ability to cool itself, making you more
            vulnerable to heat-related illnesses like sunstroke. A
            broad-spectrum sunscreen with a high SPF of 30 or more should be
            applied generously to all exposed skin, even on cloudy days.
            Reapplying it every two hours, especially after sweating or
            swimming, ensures continued protection. Sunscreen acts as a shield
            against harmful UV radiation, preventing skin damage and helping to
            regulate your body’s temperature when exposed to the sun for long
            periods.
          </p>
          <h4>4. Avoid Strenuous Activity</h4>
          <p>
            Engaging in strenuous physical activity during hot weather can
            rapidly raise your body temperature, increasing the risk of
            sunstroke. Exercising or doing heavy work outdoors, particularly
            during the hottest parts of the day, places additional stress on
            your body’s cooling mechanisms, making it harder to regulate
            temperature. To minimize this risk, it’s best to schedule physical
            activities in the early morning or late evening when the
            temperatures are cooler. If you must be active during the day, take
            regular breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas, and pace yourself
            to avoid overexertion. These precautions can significantly reduce
            the likelihood of overheating.
          </p>
          <h4>5. Acclimatize Gradually</h4>
          <p>
            For those not accustomed to hot climates, acclimatizing gradually to
            the heat can be an effective way to prevent sunstroke. Sudden and
            prolonged exposure to high temperatures can overwhelm the body’s
            ability to regulate itself. By slowly increasing the time spent
            outdoors over a few days, your body can adapt to the rising heat,
            becoming more efficient at sweating and cooling itself. This gradual
            exposure allows your body to adjust to the stress of heat, reducing
            the risk of heat-related illnesses. Whether you’re traveling to a
            hot location or transitioning into a warmer season, easing into
            outdoor activities is key to avoiding sunstroke.
